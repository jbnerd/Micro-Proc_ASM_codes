# Micro-Proc_ASM_codes

- This repository contains all the codes for the course of Micro-Processors in Microsoft Assembler (MASM)

- It consists of the lab sheets along with the codes of the tasks at the end of each lab sheet in '.asm' files.

# Assembling

- Use DOSBOX to assemble the assembly codes by typing in `ml $.asm`.
- For example if the file name is `test.asm`, using `ml test.asm` will assemble the assembly code into a machine level code.
- Upon assembling the `$.asm` produces the machine level code of the form `$.com` (in case of model tiny).
- Use `debugx $.com` and then `g` to run the program.
